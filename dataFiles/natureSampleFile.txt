Everything we see around us, right from the moment we step outside our home is part of nature. The trees, animals, landscape, flowers, trees, breeze, sunlight, everything that makes our surroundings so beautiful and mesmerizing are part of nature. Nature does not arise spontaneously but needs years and years to bloom and blossom.
According to researchers, nature we see today has developed in 4.5 billion years. Initially, the earth was not sustainable for any kind of living thing. The atmosphere had no to very little oxygen, and the same was the case with water. The land made of molten magma and the atmosphere was toxic to survive. Slowly, the earth cooled down, and life started blooming on it. It began to rain, and nature, as we see today, was formed. This nature then gifted the earth with living creatures like animals, birds, and finally, humans.
